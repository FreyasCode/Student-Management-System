# Student-Management-System

Welcome to SMS (Student Management System)! 

This is a program designed for teachers. The program can display student names alphabetically, by grades, or student ID, alongside assignments and their associated grades, class average, median, and mode. Additionally, teachers can go into "Visualization" mode and view students' marks displayed as Bar Graph, Line Graph, Pie Chart, etc. 

This program was coded using Java. Concepts such as inheritance and encapsulation were extensively used. A Linked List was also implemented from scratch. Numerous sorting algorithms were used, including insertion sort, selection sort, quick sort. 


Side note: to add JFreeChart library to your Java Project, which is required for this program to run: 

1. place jfreechart jars somewhere on your hard drive. 

2. Open Eclipse.

3. Start a new Java project like you normally would.

4. In the Package Explorer, right click your project and then click "Properties"

5. In the window that comes up, click the "Libraries" tab

6. Click "Add External JARs..."

7. Navigate to the folder you created, and highlight jcommon-1.0.x.jar (which ever version you have).

8. Click "Open"; this will add that jar to the list of external libraries.

9. Repeat 6-8 for jfreechart-1.0.x.jar and jfreechart-1.0.x-experimental.jar (if you want to use the experimental features)
